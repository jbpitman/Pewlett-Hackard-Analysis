A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md)
At the time of this data analysis Pewlett-Hackard employed approximately 300,000 individuals. 
Through analyzing the employee, department, and  title information, a total of 72,458 employees were identifed 
eligible to retire which accounts for approxiamately 25% of the total workforce.
In order lessen the effect of the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age, it would be
be beneficial to start a mentorship program to ensure continuity and transfer of institutional
knowledge. If the company plans to offer the mentorship program to those born between January 1, 1965 and 
December 31,1965, a total of 1,549 current employees would be elgible to participate in such a program. 
There are two titles that will be significantly affected by the silver tsunami: 
1) Senior Engineer (25,916 retiring indiviudals)) and 2) Senior Staff (24,926 retiring individuals). 
an additional query is needed. For both titles,  it will be helpful to obtain more information about this title in order to determine
how many current individuals are available to fill the potential vacancies  tional queries to d
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the 
next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
